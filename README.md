#   Eat Da Burger App

*   A full-stack app I made for my bootcamp that uses MySQL, Node, Express, ORM and Handlebars and       follows the MVC design pattern.
*   Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
*   Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the     page -- waiting to be devoured.
*   Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the           burger will move to the right side of the page with customer.
*   The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
